This repository contains a Go program that sends data over a ZeroMQ socket to test a verification layer. The program (`sample.go`) is designed to send Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs or any data you specify to a specified endpoint. Shell scripts are included to streamline the building and running processes.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to:

- Send data (e.g., ZK proofs) over a ZeroMQ socket.
- Test the verification layer by sending sample or actual proof data.
- Provide a simple and customizable framework for sending data using Go and ZeroMQ.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Go Programming Language**: Install Go (version 1.16 or later recommended). [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

- **ZeroMQ and CZMQ Libraries**: Install ZeroMQ, CZMQ, and `pkg-config` on your system.

  ### macOS (Using Homebrew)

  #### Install Homebrew

  Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software. If you don't have Homebrew installed, follow these steps:

  1. **Open Terminal**: You can find Terminal in **Applications > Utilities**.

  2. **Install Homebrew**: Run the following command in Terminal:

     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

     - **Note**: This command downloads and runs the Homebrew installation script from the official repository.
     - **Follow Prompts**: You may be prompted to enter your password and confirm the installation. Follow the on-screen instructions.

  3. **Verify Installation**:

     ```bash
     brew --version
     ```

     This should display the version of Homebrew installed.

  #### Install Dependencies

  With Homebrew installed, proceed to install `pkg-config`, ZeroMQ, and CZMQ:

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew install pkg-config
  brew install zeromq
  brew install czmq
  ```

  ### Ubuntu/Debian

  Update your package list and install the required packages:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y libzmq3-dev libczmq-dev pkg-config
  ```

  ### CentOS/RHEL

  First, enable the EPEL repository:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y epel-release
  ```

  Then, install the required packages:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y zeromq-devel czmq-devel pkgconfig
  ```

  ### Windows

  On Windows, you can use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install the necessary packages.

  **Steps**:

  1. **Install MSYS2**: Download and install it from [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/).

  2. **Update Package Database**:

     Open the MSYS2 MSYS terminal and run:

     ```bash
     pacman -Syuu
     ```

     Close and reopen the terminal if prompted.

  3. **Install Packages**:

     In the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal, run:

     ```bash
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-czmq
     ```

  4. **Add to PATH**:

     Ensure that the MinGW binaries are in your system's `PATH`. You can add the following to your environment variables:

     ```
     C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
     ```

     Adjust the path if you installed MSYS2 in a different location.

- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/layer-edge/verification-layer-tester.git
cd verification-layer-tester
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the Go package for ZeroMQ:

```bash
go get gopkg.in/zeromq/goczmq.v4
```

**Note**: If you encounter errors related to `pkg-config`, ensure it's installed and properly configured in your system's `PATH` (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

---

## Usage

### Building the Program

Use the provided `build.sh` script to build the `sample` executable:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script compiles `sample.go` and produces an executable named `sample`.

### Running the Program

Use the `run.sh` script to run the program.

#### Using a Proof File

If you have a proof file (e.g., `proof.json`), you can provide it as an argument:

```bash
./run.sh proof.json
```

#### Manual Input

If you want to input the proof data manually:

```bash
./run.sh
```

When prompted, paste your proof data and press Enter.

#### Using the Default Proof

If you run `./run.sh` and press Enter without typing anything when prompted, the program will use a default proof value defined in `sample.go`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Error: `pkg-config`: executable file not found in $PATH

**Cause**: `pkg-config` is not installed or not in your system's `PATH`.

**Solution**:

- **macOS**:

  ```bash
  brew install pkg-config
  ```

- **Ubuntu/Debian**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config
  ```

- **CentOS/RHEL**:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y pkgconfig
  ```

- **Windows**:

  - Install MSYS2 and use `pacman` to install `pkg-config`.

    ```bash
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config
    ```

  - Ensure `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` is added to your system's `PATH`.

#### Cannot Connect to Endpoint

- **Solution**:

  - Verify that the endpoint in `sample.go` is correct and accessible.
  - Replace `tcp://34.71.52.251:40000` with your own endpoint if necessary.

#### Missing Dependencies

- **Solution**:

  - Ensure all Go packages and system libraries are installed.

    ```bash
    go get gopkg.in/zeromq/goczmq.v4
    ```

#### Permission Denied

- **Solution**:

  - Ensure the scripts are executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x build.sh run.sh
    ```

#### ZeroMQ Issues

- **Solution**:

  - Ensure that ZeroMQ and CZMQ are properly installed on your system.
  - Verify installation:

    ```bash
    pkg-config --modversion libzmq
    pkg-config --modversion libczmq
    ```
